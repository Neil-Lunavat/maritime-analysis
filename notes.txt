Data Gathering
marrinetraffic.com 
used the network tab in the inspect window to find where the website sends get request to the backend 
found that it sends get request to https://www.marinetraffic.com/getData/get_data_json_4/z:3/X:2/Y:1/station:0
therefore I sent it as well and got the json data 
https://www.marinetraffic.com/getData/get_data_json_4/z:1/X:0/Y:0/station:0
Here, the z, X and Y values when changed in the range of 0 to 3 give more data
Each request gives up to 2.5 thousand entries. Combined scraping gets us XYZ amount

converted it to CSV using pandas using script.py

Data Exploration
firstly, the usage of AI to speed up the process of coding without worrying of syntax was a lot in this project
in terms of data exploration, the first objective was to understand what each column meant and how they relate to each other 
understanding the coverage of data in terms of how many NaN values vs valid values
if it was possible to fill up NaN values using the other data 
seeing which columns could be dropped that pose no significant value (feature engineering)

=== COLUMN DEFINITIONS ===
LAT          : Latitude - Geographic coordinate (North-South position)
LON          : Longitude - Geographic coordinate (East-West position)
SPEED        : Vessel speed in knots or other units
COURSE       : Direction of travel in degrees (0-360°, where 0°=North)
HEADING      : Direction vessel bow is pointing (may differ from course due to drift)
ELAPSED      : Time elapsed since last update/ping
DESTINATION  : Intended destination port or location
FLAG         : Country flag/registration of the vessel
LENGTH       : Overall length of vessel in meters
SHIPNAME     : Name identifier of the vessel
SHIPTYPE     : Numeric code for vessel type
SHIP_ID      : Unique identifier for the vessel
WIDTH        : Beam (width) of vessel in meters
L_FORE       : Distance from GPS antenna to bow
W_LEFT       : Distance from GPS antenna to port side
DWT          : Deadweight Tonnage - cargo carrying capacity
GT_SHIPTYPE  : Gross Tonnage ship type classification
ROT          : Rate of Turn in degrees per minute
TYPE_IMG     : Numeric code for vessel type image/icon
TYPE_NAME    : Human-readable vessel type name
STATUS_NAME  : Current operational status of vessel

conclusions: 
TYPE_IMG and TYPE_NAME were only 911 out of 2449
they were both NaN or both existed, one wasn't present without the other
therefore TYPE_IMG could be dropped
SPEED could be determined if STATUS_NAME exists, if anchored speed is 0
ROT (rate of turning) could be filled with 0 instead of NaN since most ships that aren't rotating if they're on the right course
from latitude and longitude range we can find that the data covers ship information from argentinian sea and indian ocean below to north atlantic ocean and kara sea (using gps-coordinates.net)
STATUS_NAME exists for 865 ships, TYPE_NAME exists for 879 ships
the overlap is almost 100%, when STATUS_NAME exists TYPE_NAME also exists
therefore we can't fill the NaN values logically and might have to drop some data

optimistic outlook on opportunities (before analysis if it's really possible, ideas on what we can do with the data):
VIS
-> port traffic analysis 
-> heatmaps of vessel density and traffic patterns 
ML
-> Vessel Type Classification based on movement patterns
-> Anomaly detection (unusual speed patterns, eg. cargo ship moving at 200 knots)
-> Suspicious movement patterns (would require continuous data overtime)

features that would help: 
LAT LON SPEED COURSE 
SHIPTYPE STATUS_NAME TYPE_NAME
Vessel Dimensions 

Data Imputation (filling up NaN to make data more useful)
AI Suggestions: 
speed -> at "anchor / moored" speed = 0

HEADING vs COURSE Deep Analysis
discovered that heading (where ship bow points) and course (where ship actually moves) tell different stories
analyzed 989 vessels with both data points
- 51.5% have close alignment (≤5° difference) = ships moving efficiently in straight direction
- 43.2% have large differences (>10°) = drift, maneuvering, or potential problems

speed correlation is huge:
- fast vessels (>10 knots): 82.1% have close H-C alignment (overpowering drift)
- slow vessels (≤2 knots): only 7.0% alignment (getting pushed around by wind/current)

examples from data:
- CAPE BYRON: H=232°, C=232° (perfect alignment, 88 knots - efficient movement)
- SORION: H=90°, C=28° (62° difference, 1 knot - small boat drifting)
- SEAHARMONY: H=222°, C=27° (165° difference, 0 knots - stationary vessel being pushed)

vessel size impact (key insight):
small ships get pushed around way more than large ships
created danger scoring system with size multipliers:
- small vessels (<50m): 2.0-2.5x multiplier 
- large vessels (>150m): 1.0x multiplier
- small vessels: 40% in critical danger vs large vessels: 0% critical danger

most dangerous vessels all tiny boats (8-24m) with extreme H-C differences (139-177°)
this makes sense - 1m fishing boat with 147° difference = serious problem
200m cargo ship with same difference = probably just normal course correction

imputation strategy:
for missing HEADING can use COURSE ± small variation for fast-moving vessels
1,318+ vessels could benefit from this
both columns valuable, neither droppable
H-C difference itself is valuable feature for anomaly detection and safety monitoring

business applications:
coast guard priority system, insurance risk assessment, port monitoring
extreme differences (>90°) could flag vessels in distress/mechanical failure
