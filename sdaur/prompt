5-8 minutes, casual kinda thing like it should be a 70% technical 90% fck around find out kinda thing 
Like, I had to do this project and I came on this reel that told me this website gives ships data so I just had curiosity that oh what if I do this what if I build a scraper what if I analyse the variables like this and that and so on using statistics knowledge and stuff and then finally I came to some conclusions that made me HAVE the idea that okay if we get a time series data out of this by scraping for 24 times a day it would actually be able to apply ML models on it and then it became this massive data science project that it wasnt before and thats what I want to portray which is genuine curiosity. Okay so with this in mind
